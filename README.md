Tour Guide App Android Basic Nanodegree Schorlarship by Google &amp; Udacity: Project 05


## Project Overview
The final project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own multi-screen Android app to share your knowledge about a city you are very familiar with. 
The goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. Itâ€™s up to you which categories you want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category. 

## Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you worked to build the Miwok language app, which taught you how to present information in a multi-screen app to your users. Now, you will practice that skillset by presenting information that you care about in your own life to a user. Your Tour Guide app will be unique to your city, your life, and your interests. 

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Planning your app design and navigation before coding
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
* Building layouts to display those lists of data
* Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout or Navigation Drawer*
* Creating your own custom classes
* Properly handling images or audio (if applicable)
* Navigation Drawers were not covered in this course, but you may choose to implement it in this app. 

Note: As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted. Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted.
